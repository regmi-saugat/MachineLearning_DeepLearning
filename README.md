**Day1 of MachineLearningDeepLearning**

- **Natural Language Processing:** It is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with interactions between computers and human language, in particulars how to program computers to process and analyze large amount of natural language data. In my journey of MachineLearning DeepLearning, I am brushing up on my skills of NLP. Today I got an overview of different text preprocessing processes such as Tokenization, Stopword removal, Stemming, Lemmatization and I implemented a few of them. I hope you will gain some insights and hope you will also spend time learning the topics. Excited about the days ahead ! 

**Day2 of MachineLearningDeepLearning**

- **Text Preprocessing:** It is a crucial step that involves cleaning and transforming raw text data into a format that can be easily analyzed and understood by machine learning models. Today I have learned more about preprocessing steps like One Hot Encoding (OHE), Bag of Words, N-grams and implemented them in code. I hope you will gain some insights and hope you will also spend time learning the topics. Excited about the days ahead !
